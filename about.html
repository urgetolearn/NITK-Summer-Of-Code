        About NITK Summer of Code
      </h1>
      <h2>Aim</h2>
      <p>
        NITK Summer of Code aims at helping students get started with open
        source projects that tries to solve real world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Summer of Code has a philosophy very similar to larger programs like
        GSoC, LFX and Outreachy. And it also prepares you for such open source
        contributions by providing a similar environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The participants will learn how to prepare a project application, work
        in teams, understand the importance of effective communication, and most
        importantly, work with large codebases. They will also learn the
        intricate workflows and good coding practices.
      </p>
      <h2>Program Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Summer of Code is a program organized with a focus on introducing the
        student developers across the world to open source software and hardware
        development. The students can work with projects proposed by the
        Technical clubs, Open Source Organizations over the Summer break. This
        program also plans to introduce to students the rigorous process of
        developing a project proposal similar to that of GSoC.
      </p>

      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        Anyone who is interested in contributing to open source! There will be
        students from all years and so projects of varying difficulty are
        needed.
      </p>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Projects of different levels of difficulty, catering to different skill
        sets and expertise, will be available. The projects will cover different
        domains, as much as possible. The projects can be proposed by students
        (Bachelors, Masters and Ph.D.), faculty members, administrative offices
        (for example, HODs, Chairman, Deans, Deputy Director and Director), NITK
        Alumnus,and by the various clubs at NITK willing to mentor students. The
        projects will be accepted by the organizing committee based on their
        merit and feasibility for the duration of the Summer of Code program.
        New projects, as well as projects with an existing codebase, are
        allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mentors must submit projects which can be worked on for a minimum period
        of 8 weeks. Each project must have 2 mentors. Projects should be divided
        into small tasks/issues. The mentors should also include some tasks to
        judge the candidate prior to selecting them for the progra,. The mentors
        are free to conduct any kind of evaluation (interviews, patch
        requirements, etc) required to select the candidates before the
        deadline.
      </p>
      <p>
        The students can apply to projects either by filling a Google form or
        completing a small task, which is at the discretion of the mentors. A
        student can apply to a maximum of 2 projects.
      </p>
