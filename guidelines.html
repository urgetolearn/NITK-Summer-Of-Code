                obtaining feedback from each entity of the other. It is
                mandatory that all entities fill out the evaluation form before
                the stipulated deadline.
              </li>
              <li>

          <li>

            completion of the project. No deadline extension shall be granted,
            except in genuine cases.
          </li>

        <p></p>
        <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The mentor(s) mentioned in the project proposal and mentor form for
            the project will only be considered responsible for the project and
            will serve as the point of contact.

            resource for a mentee during the course of their project.
