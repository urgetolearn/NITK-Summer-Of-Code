## What is NITK-SOC?
Contributing to open-source projects during college is immensely beneficial for students. It offers real-world experience in software development, collaboration, and problem-solving, which are invaluable in a professional setting.  Joining such communities right from college gives additional boost and confidence for tackling industrial needs. In our open-source initiative, mentors and project administrators will be *seniors and alumni from NITK Surathkal*, bringing their wealth of experience and expertise to guide new contributors. Conversely, Mentees can be *students from any college*, creating a diverse and inclusive environment for learning and collaboration. This structure ensures that mentees receive top-notch guidance from seasoned professionals while fostering a broad and vibrant community of learners and contributors.
